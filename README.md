# Data Prediction Data Analysis Competition 2023
Participate in the Data Analytic Competition 2023 by the Statistics Association of the Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology (HIMASTA-ITS) at Statistic Fair 2023. Participants were given a problem to predict multiple classes. This project is aimed at finding the types of attacks that exist on the network. <br>
This project goes through several stages such as: data preprocessing, feature encoding, model development, model evaluation, and summary

**Machine Learning algorithms used:**
1. Support Vector Machine (Scikit-learn)
<br>

**Summary**
|Model|Accuracy|
|--|--|
|SVM|0.9320|
<br>
The SVM model is good enough, as evidenced by the high accuracy value which reaches 0.9320.
